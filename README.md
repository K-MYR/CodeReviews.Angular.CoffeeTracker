## Description

## Getting Started

### Required Installation Steps

* Restore NuGet packages.
* Insert your SQL Server connection string into `appsettings.json`.  
* There is no need to run `npm restore`, as all necessary packages are already bundled.
* If the 'SeedData' and 'Auto-Migrate' options in `appsettings.json` are set to 'true', the latest migration will automatically be applied to the database, and seed data will be inserted.
